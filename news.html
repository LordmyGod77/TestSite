						<h2>How much can I afford?</h2>
						<p>
							This depends on your income, credit history, and debts. Depending on these factors you may be able to afford enough to buy a home. This is why it is important that buyers go through pre-approval prior to viewing houses.

						</div>
												<h2>How much can I sell for?</h2>
						<p>
							This depends on location, condition of property, square footage, and type of house. Agents are normally trained on providing a Comparative Market Analysis which is a value analysis of a property based on market data in the relevant area. I would love to tell you how much your house is potentially worth.

						</div>
												<h2>What sort of financing is available?</h2>
						<p>
							This includes Agricultural loans, FHA Loans, Conventional loans, and VA loans. These all have varying requirements and benefits such as low to no down payment to a large down payment. Depending on what you qualify for financing may be a breeze or more difficult. The process is very detail oriented and requirement based.

				<h4>Fact:</h4>
				<p>
					Many individuals who rent property can actually afford a mortgage and they do not realize it. People could be homeowners way sooner if they just talked to the right agent to learn about what they can really afford.
