			<h1>About Me</h1>
						<h2>My History</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Avrey James Anderson. I have been a resident of Dripping Springs, Texas, for 14 years. I went to Dripping Springs High School. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration. I am also a Realtor at Robert Slack LLC. I specialize in residential property.
			</p>
			<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
			<p>
				What of the core tenets of being a Realtor is to maintain confidentiality under any circumstances in regard to my client's personal business. I will not ever divulge any information a client tells me unless they are asking me to do so. The reason behind this is to maintain the dignity and security of my clients ,and to ensure that they get the best representation during the negiation process.
			</p>
			<h2>Fair Dealing and Honesty</h2>
			<p>
				Realtors are to be fair and honest to everyone they interact with. The one exception to this is maintaining the confidentiality of a client. Certain things, such as property defects, cannot remain confidential. Honesty and fairness must be preserved to everyone to ensure that no one is getting treated unfairly or illegally.
			</p>
			<h2>Advocacy</h2>
			<p>
				My job as a Realtor is to help my client in acquiring, selling, leasing, or managing property. This means ensuring that preparations are made in every step of the process to ensure effective representation of my clients. I am an advocate on behalf of you as my client against any other party to the transaction. I will use any means necessary to ensure that my clients are getting the best deal they can get.

				<h4>Fact:</h4>

					Many individuals who rent property can actually afford a mortgage and they do not realize it. People could be homeowners way sooner if they just talked to the right agent to learn about what they can really afford.
